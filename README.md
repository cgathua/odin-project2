# odin-project2
 This is the second odin project, that involves building a landing page website, from a provided design. 
 The assignment is a test, of the understanding of FLEXBOX.
 It is a desktop only requirement, but it's still responsive on all screens.
 A hamburger menu on mobile is not included, as it's not part of the assignment.
 The assigned templates from The Odin Project are in the template folder.
